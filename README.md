# Leetcode-pyq

This repo is my personal record of solving problems on leetcode.com.

This repo contains three folders:

--codes: It contains the source code files, one for each problem. At the head of each file, I give a clear explanation of the code.
 
--notes: This folder contains my understandings and further thoughts for each problem. 

--sources: It contains anything I find useful when solving and reviewing problems, such as a book or a blog.
